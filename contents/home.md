Why do people continue to disagree on contentious political issues like climate change, despite ample scientific evidence and years of public discussion? In my research, I explore how social influence shapes opinions of individuals and how such processes aggregate to opinion patterns in society using mathematical modelling. I focus on understanding cognitive biases and their role in opinion formation on an individual and collective level, whether fostering polarisation or supporting the persistence of minority views. For example, social identity biases can drive polarisation. However, surprisingly, I find that biases can sometimes foster consensus in certain circumstances and may help us to overcome polarisation on climate change. Their impact varies based on factors like influence networks, ambiguities in communication, and perceptions of others' opinions subject to social identities.
