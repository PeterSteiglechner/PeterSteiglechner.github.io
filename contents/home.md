Why do human societies persist to disagree on political topics like climate change measures despite overwhelming scientific evidence and decades of public debate? In my PhD at ZMT Bremen, I develop agent-based models to study how social influence shapes opinion patterns in society. I am particularly interested in the role of cognitive biases and their various manifestations in the process of opinion formation. The models can help us understand how the impacts of these biases aggregate to public opinion patterns like polarisation or the persistence of certain minority opinions. Contrary to usual expectations, biases can help consensus formation and reduce polarisation in many situations. Its effects depend, for example, on structural features of communications (networks), the presence of noise and ambiguity in communication and the specific micro-level assumptions.
